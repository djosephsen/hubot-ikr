# Hubot: IKNOWRIGHT?!

hubot-ikr listens for adverb-phrases that commonly convey enthusiasm, and
responds by validating the shit out of them. 

![IKNOWRIGHT?!](usage_example.png)

Sometimes responding to every trigger word is too much for some users so you 
can turn hubot's agreeability down with the command:

```
be less agreeable
```

If you turn the agreeability down too far you can adjust it back up by saying:

```
be more agreeable
```

Agreeability setting is based on the TARS humor setting in the movie 
Interstellar so it responds to a percentage (integer).  So, if you want to 
set it to a specific percentage you can say:

```
set agreeability to 60% 
```

To query the current agreeability setting just ask:

```
agreeability?
```

or use any variant thereof with "agreeability?" in the question, like:

```
What is your current agreeability?
```
